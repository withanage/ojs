This paper looks at the key role of nurturing efficacy beliefs in order to learn and participate in school and society. Research findings conducted within a social studies context are presented, showing how strategy instruction can enhance self-efficacy for learning. As part of this research, Creative Problem Solving (CPS) was taught to children as a means to motivate and support learning. It is shown that the use of CPS can have positive effects on self-efficacy for learning, and be a valuable framework to involve children in decision-making that leads to social action. Implications for enhancing self-efficacy and motivation to learn in the classroom are discussed.',
